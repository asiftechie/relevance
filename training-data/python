Python Developers Needed

Does your knowledge of Django extend beyond the Quentin Tarrantino film?

Do you love the fact that Python is now common place in System Administration too?

Do you enjoy testing out the new frameworks and creating repositories on github?

Are you proud to be working with an Open Source language?

Do you want to work for one of Europe's top employers of Python Developers?

Python job adverts are fun to write, you can litter them with puns,my Linked In statuses sing true to this. The key thing is that Python development is pretty cool. Tarrantino has brought the word "Django" into the limelight but very few know that it is a framework of Python.

All of a sudden your friends have heard the word, they don't have any further knowledge as to what you actually do but you are somewhat cooler now!

Fancy working for a pretty awesome company too? Whilst you may not have heard of them yet, you will do over the next 2 years as they will be sponsoring Python events across the globe. In the last 5 years they have grown from 14 people to over 700 and have recently agreed two multi-million dollar deals.

Python development is their thing!
